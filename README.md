Overview
The Currency Converter allows users to input an amount in one currency and quickly view the equivalent value in another. By leveraging Java’s object-oriented programming capabilities, the application ensures modular, maintainable, and reusable code. The design is straightforward, making it suitable for beginners learning Java as well as developers looking to build practical utility applications.

Features
-User-Friendly Input & Output: The program accepts user input for the amount and currency types, validating entries for accuracy.
-Multi-Currency Support: Includes a set of popular world currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, INR, JPY, and more).
-Dynamic Calculations: Uses predefined exchange rates (that can be updated easily) or can be extended to fetch live exchange rates from APIs.
-Scalable Design: Built with a modular approach, allowing developers to add new currencies or integrate external services with minimal effort.
-Console Interface: Provides a clear, text-based interaction for simplicity, while the logic can also be integrated into GUI or web apps.

Technical Details
-Language: Java (compatible with JDK 8+)
-Concepts Used: Classes, methods, control structures, exception handling, and collections.
-Implementation: Conversion logic is encapsulated in a separate class, making it reusable across different interfaces. The main program handles user interaction, while the core logic handles conversion.
-Extensibility: By updating the currency rate map or connecting to APIs, the application can function with real-time exchange information.

Use Cases
-Quick personal estimates of amounts when dealing with multiple currencies.
-Educational project for students learning Java basics and object-oriented programming.
-A foundation for building advanced financial or e-commerce systems that need currency support.

Future Enhancements
-Integration with real-time exchange rate APIs.
-Graphical User Interface (Swing/JavaFX).
-Multi-language support for broader usability.
-This project demonstrates how Java can be applied to solve practical problems in finance, combining programming fundamentals with real-world utility.
